# My First Poker Game
<h3> Author: Pablo Loren-Aguilar </h3>

My kids asked me to download a poker game for their phones, but I didn't like the idea of exposing them to online gambling yet, so I decided to create my own one. The game uses the open source treys poker library (https://github.com/ihendley/treys) in order to calculate all the poker maths associated with the game, and uses the cards and chips images found in the open source blackjack game by Torbj√∂rn Hedqvist (https://github.com/torbjornhedqvist/blackjack)
