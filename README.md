# My First Poker Game v1.0

My kids asked me to download a poker game for their phones, but I didn't like the idea of exposing them to online gambling yet, so I decided to create my own one. The game uses the open source treys poker library (https://github.com/ihendley/treys) in order to calculate all the poker maths associated with the game, and uses the cards and chips images found in the open source blackjack game by Torbj√∂rn Hedqvist (https://github.com/torbjornhedqvist/blackjack)

The game plays poker using a simple "positive expected value" approach. The game calculates the probabilities of obtaining long term benefits when playing a specific hand. If the value is positive, the hand will be played, otherwise it will not. To make it more human, a random variable is added to the calculation in order to make the game play weak hands or to emulate bluffs.
