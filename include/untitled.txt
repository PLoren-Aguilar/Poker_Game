* Poker game: things to do.

- Implement a betting algorithm for the program. I also need to implement an "all in" rule.
- Create a "pot" that can be added to the player's money -> DONE!
- Decide if I want to represent the bets with actual chips on the table (this would be cooler) or a counter-> DONE!
- Implement an "elimination function":
     -> Not sure how to do it. 
     -> I could eliminate the player from the list, but not sure how to respect the position of buttons and chips.
